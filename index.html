<p><a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> is an award-winning content management system (CMS), which enables you to build Web sites and powerful online applications. Many aspects, including its ease-of-use and extensibility, have made Joomla the most popular Web site software available. Best of all, Joomla is an open source solution that is freely available to everyone.</p>

<h3><a name="html5" class="anchor" href="#html5"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HTML5</h3>

<p>We all know that HTML5 is the latest iteration of HTML addressing modern needs and expectations of websites. It deals with things like semantic markup, providing information about content it describes, it is becoming new standard for all good web developers and browser vendors love it as it does its magic on both desktops and mobiles.</p>

<p>With new functionalities that an awesome combination of CSS3 and HTML5 give us functionalities so that we can do things that were never possible to achieve in pure HTML or require javascript or external plugins like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight are now achievable in a browser through HTML5.</p>

<h3><a name="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I intend to do?</h3>

<p>HTML 5 doesn't touch the Joomla's form fields. Therefore, it is very important
that we inhance the repositry of form fields available in Joomla Platform and
incorporate HTML 5 in them. HTML 5 introduces us with new elements and some
attributes for existing elements.</p>

<h3><a name="new-in-html5" class="anchor" href="#new-in-html5"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is new in HTML5 form?</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/forms.html#forms">current specification</a> of HTML5 we have almost 4 new elements, <a href="http://cdn.sixrevisions.com/demos/0345-new_html5_form_input_types/new-html5-form-input-types.html">14 new input types</a> and 21 new attribues for new and old elements and input types.</p>

<p>Since HTML5 is fairly new and not all the details have been worked out yet, not all web browsers support HTML5 features the same way. Is you browser support HTML5 or not? To test it visit <a href="http://html5test.com/">html5test.com</a> in the browser to test it. To know which browsers are supporting which features and to what degree visit <a href="http://www.wufoo.com/html5">wufoo.com</a></p>
